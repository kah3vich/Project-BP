# Security Policy

We take security seriously. This document outlines how to report vulnerabilities and what to expect during the disclosure process.

## Reporting a vulnerability

### Do it

1. Report privately using one of these methods:
   - GitHub Security Advisory (**preferred**)

     ```
     https://github.com/[OWNER]/[REPO]/security/advisories/new
     ```

   - Email (**fallback**)

     ```
      [OWNER-EMAIL]
     ```

2. Include in your report:
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Affected component/version
   - Steps to reproduce (PoC code welcome)
   - Potential impact (CVSS score if known)
   - Suggested mitigation (optional)

### Don't do it

- Open public issues/discussions about vulnerabilities
- Share details publicly before a fix is released
- Attempt exploitation beyond minimal proof-of-concept

## Supported versions

Only the latest stable release receives security updates.
Unsupported versions won't receive patches.
